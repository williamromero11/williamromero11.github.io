Entry-level IT and cybersecurity professional pursuing a B.S. in Information Technology with hands-on experience in IT support, network troubleshooting, and system security. Eligible for security clearance and seeking an internship or junior role in system administration or cybersecurity to support secure systems, network operations, and incident response. 

## About Me
I’m a 24‑year‑old IT and Cybersecurity student from Venezuela, currently living in Orlando, Florida. I’ve been passionate about technology for as long as I can remember, especially how different systems interact and how to protect them from threats. That interest has also led me to building custom PCs—where I focus on both performance and security in every build.

Outside of academics and tech, I’m a big fan of deep, strategic games like Elden Ring, The Witcher 3, and Baldur’s Gate 3. These games have taught me a lot about persistence, creative problem‑solving, and strategic thinking. I also read a lot, particularly epic fantasy. A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin is one of my favorites—it inspired my fascination with complex systems, layered narratives, and how small details can shape entire worlds, which ties back to how I think about cybersecurity.

I try to bring the lessons I learn from gaming and literature—strategy, ethics, and attention to detail—into my IT and security work every day.

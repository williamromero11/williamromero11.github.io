I am an entry level IT and cybersecurity student currently completing my degree in Information Technology. My interests focus on system administration, network security, and defensive security operations. I am looking for an internship or junior role where I can contribute to maintaining secure systems, supporting network operations, and assisting with incident response while continuing to grow my technical skills.

## About Me
I am a 24 year old IT and cybersecurity student originally from Venezuela and currently living in Orlando, Florida. I have been interested in technology from a young age, particularly how systems interact and how they can be protected from misuse or attack. This interest naturally led me to building custom PCs, where I focus on reliability, performance, and security in each build.

Outside of academics, I enjoy strategy driven games such as Elden Ring, The Witcher 3, and Baldur’s Gate 3. These games reinforce skills that translate well to cybersecurity, including persistence, critical thinking, and problem solving under pressure. I am also an avid reader of epic fantasy, especially A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin. The complexity of its world building and interconnected systems mirrors how I approach technical environments and security challenges.

I try to apply these habits of careful analysis, attention to detail, and ethical thinking to my academic and technical work.

## 👨‍💻 Security Labs & Competitions

### [OCPS Cyber Challenge](https://hackucf.org/cyber-challenge) | January 2026  
Participated in a competitive cybersecurity challenge designed to simulate real world defensive and offensive security scenarios in an enterprise style network. I worked in a two person team and placed 5th out of 60 teams. The competition involved ethical hacking tasks, network defense, system hardening, and vulnerability analysis under time constraints. This experience strengthened my teamwork skills and reinforced my ability to analyze security problems quickly and methodically.

### [HACK@UCF Cyber Challenge CTF](https://hackucf.org/ctf) | February 2025  
Competed in a scenario based Capture the Flag event focused on enterprise breach investigation and incident response. Tasks included network reconnaissance, service enumeration, and basic forensic analysis to identify compromised systems and recover data. The event emphasized structured investigation, rapid threat assessment, and working effectively under pressure.

### [Linux Active Directory & System Administration Lab](https://github.com/williamromero11/linux-active-directory-lab) | November 2025
Completed a hands on lab focused on identity and access management in a multi server virtualized environment. I deployed and managed a Linux based domain controller using Samba Active Directory, Kerberos, DNS, and NTP. The lab focused on least privilege access, automated administration through scripting, and validating directory services through structured testing. This project strengthened my understanding of system administration, authentication services, and security hardening in enterprise environments.

Entry-level IT and cybersecurity professional pursuing a B.S. in Information Technology with hands-on experience in IT support, network troubleshooting, and system security. Eligible for security clearance and seeking an internship or junior role in system administration or cybersecurity to support secure systems, network operations, and incident response. 

## About Me
I’m a 24‑year‑old IT and Cybersecurity student from Venezuela, currently living in Orlando, Florida. I’ve been passionate about technology for as long as I can remember, especially how different systems interact and how to protect them from threats. That interest has also led me to building custom PCs—where I focus on both performance and security in every build.

Outside of academics and tech, I’m a big fan of deep, strategic games like Elden Ring, The Witcher 3, and Baldur’s Gate 3. These games have taught me a lot about persistence, creative problem‑solving, and strategic thinking. I also read a lot, particularly epic fantasy. A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin is one of my favorites—it inspired my fascination with complex systems, layered narratives, and how small details can shape entire worlds, which ties back to how I think about cybersecurity.

I try to bring the lessons I learn from gaming and literature—strategy, ethics, and attention to detail—into my IT and security work every day.

## 👨‍💻 Security Labs & Competitions

### [OCPS Cyber Challenge](https://hackucf.org/cyber-challenge) | January 2026  
A competitive, hands-on cybersecurity challenge designed to simulate real-world offensive and defensive security scenarios within a secured, enterprise-style network environment. Hosted in collaboration with Orange Technical College and regional cyber initiatives, the event featured Capture The Flag (CTF)–style exercises focused on ethical hacking, network defense, and system hardening. Participants analyzed simulated infrastructures, identified vulnerabilities, and applied defensive countermeasures under realistic constraints. This experience strengthened practical skills in cyber defense fundamentals, adversarial thinking, and collaborative problem-solving, while reinforcing career pathways in cybersecurity and incident response.

### [Linux Active Directory & System Administration Lab](https://github.com/williamromero11/linux-active-directory-lab) | November 2025
A hands-on lab simulating enterprise identity and access management in a multi-server virtualized environment. This hands-on lab demonstrates the deployment and management of a Linux-based Active Directory environment in a virtualized, multi-server setup. Using Samba AD, Kerberos, DNS, and NTP, I configured a domain controller to simulate enterprise-level identity and access management. The project emphasized security best practices, including least-privilege access, automated administration via Bash and PowerShell scripts, and validation of directory services through structured testing. This lab reflects practical skills in system administration, security hardening, and infrastructure automation — core competencies for roles in cybersecurity, IT operations, and cloud administration.

### [HACK@UCF Cyber Challenge CTF](https://hackucf.org/ctf) | February 2025  
A scenario-based cybersecurity competition simulating real-world enterprise breach investigation and incident response under time-constrained conditions. This Capture The Flag challenge required practical application of network reconnaissance, service enumeration, and forensic analysis techniques to identify compromised systems and recover critical data flags. The competition emphasized rapid threat assessment, systematic investigation methodologies, and adherence to incident response protocols while working within competitive time constraints. This experience demonstrates applied skills in defensive security operations, threat hunting, and real-time problem-solving — valuable competencies for roles in SOC analysis, incident response, and penetration testing.

# Coding Portfolio

### [Project # 1: Campus Parking System](https://github.com/williamromero11/Project-1)
Campus Parking System is a C program implementing a comprehensive parking management simulation for a university campus. Built with strict adherence to dynamic memory allocation principles, the system models real-world parking operations through efficient data structures and command-driven interactions.

The program demonstrates advanced C programming concepts including pointer arithmetic, multi-dimensional dynamic arrays, and memory management while solving a practical problem space. It features a complete command-line interface for managing multiple garages, tracking registered vehicles, and providing real-time utilization analytics.

Key technical achievements include zero memory leaks (validated via Valgrind), optimized string handling with exact-size allocations, and a modular architecture that cleanly separates data structures, business logic, and I/O operations.

### [Project # 2: Traffic Fine Management System (BST)](https://github.com/williamromero11/Project-2)
Traffic Fine Management System is a C program implementing a comprehensive traffic violation tracking system using Binary Search Tree (BST) data structures. Built with meticulous attention to tree algorithms and recursive design patterns, the system models municipal fine administration through efficient hierarchical organization and command-driven operations.

The program demonstrates advanced C programming concepts including recursive algorithms, pointer-based tree structures, and dynamic memory management while solving a practical governance problem. It features a complete command-line interface for managing vehicle owner records, processing fine transactions, and providing real-time tree analytics.

Key technical achievements include O(log n) average-case operations, proper recursive memory deallocation, and a modular architecture that cleanly separates tree operations, business logic, and user interaction layers.

### [Project # 3: Nile Dot Com E-Store Simulation (Event-Driven GUI)](https://github.com/williamromero11/Project-3)
Nile Dot Com E-Store Simulation is a Java-based standalone GUI application implementing a comprehensive e-commerce simulation through event-driven programming principles. Built with Swing and adhering to model-view-controller separation, the system models online retail operations including inventory management, shopping cart functionality, and transaction logging.

The program demonstrates advanced Java concepts including event handling, file I/O operations, GUI component management, and object-oriented design while solving a practical e-commerce problem. It features a complete graphical interface for managing store inventory, processing customer orders, and maintaining permanent transaction records.

Key technical achievements include thread-safe CSV file operations, dynamic GUI state management, proper separation of business logic from presentation layer, and comprehensive error handling for all user interaction scenarios.

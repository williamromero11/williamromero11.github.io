### [Project # 1: Campus Parking System](https://github.com/williamromero11/Assignment-1)
Campus Parking System is a C program implementing a comprehensive parking management simulation for a university campus. Built with strict adherence to dynamic memory allocation principles, the system models real-world parking operations through efficient data structures and command-driven interactions.

The program demonstrates advanced C programming concepts including pointer arithmetic, multi-dimensional dynamic arrays, and memory management while solving a practical problem space. It features a complete command-line interface for managing multiple garages, tracking registered vehicles, and providing real-time utilization analytics.

Key technical achievements include zero memory leaks (validated via Valgrind), optimized string handling with exact-size allocations, and a modular architecture that cleanly separates data structures, business logic, and I/O operations.
